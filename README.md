# Ball Game
This repository contains the code for a ball game.
## Working
- The balls falls smoothly at a constant rate. The balls will have a random diameter from 10px to 100px.
- You can change the speed at which the ball falls with the help of slider.
- At the slider’s left-most position, balls will fall at a speed of 10px per second and at the slider’s right-most position, should fall at a speed of 100px per second.
- After every 1000ms, a new ball will appear in the screen.
- If you click over any ball then that particular ball will disappear and after 1000ms, a new ball with a random diameter will appear on the screen.
- After a total of 4000ms the game will stop.
- Each ball will have a point inversely propotional to its size. Example -> 10px balls worth 10 points, and 100px balls worth 1 point.
- Total score will be equal to the sum of the points each ball carries.
